// PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION and ABSTRACT BASE CLASS

/*
Pure Virtual Functions in C++
Pure virtual function is a function that doesnâ€™t perform any operation and the function is declared by
assigning the value 0 to it. Pure virtual functions are declared in abstract classes.


Abstract Base Class in C++
Abstract base class is a class that has at least one pure virtual function in its body. The classes which 
are inheriting the base class must need to override the virtual function of the abstract class otherwise
compiler will throw an error.

Example :  line 25 and 52

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// full class is Abstract base class
class base
{
    public:
        int a = 5;

        void display () = 0;    //Pure Virtual Function
};
*/
